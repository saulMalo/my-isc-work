Important instructions on using MatPlotLib interactively
========================================================

*Source:* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28269157/plotting-in-a-non-blocking-way-with-matplotlib

On the CentOS linux laptops used in the ISC course we found that it is possible to work with the 
MatPlotLib "pyplot" interface interactively if you use:

`plt.pause(0.1)`

instead of:

`plt.show()`

What does this do? Well, here are the docs for the `pyplot.pause` function:

```
Help on function pause in module matplotlib.pyplot:

pause(interval)
    Pause for *interval* seconds.
    
    If there is an active figure it will be updated and displayed,
    and the GUI event loop will run during the pause.
    
    If there is no active figure, or if a non-interactive backend
    is in use, this executes time.sleep(interval).
    
    This can be used for crude animation. For more complex
    animation, see :mod:`matplotlib.animation`.
    
    This function is experimental; its behavior may be changed
    or extended in a future release.
```
